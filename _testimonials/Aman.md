Hey... I know I will be short of words describing you. You are a great friend, an awesome person and undoubtedly the funniest guy I have met. We have shared countless memories without which I cannot even imagine my life here at IIT Kanpur and I will always cherish them. Late night walks of you, me, salil and mayank .. sharing secrets and you pleading to mishra not to reveal school time secrets... Our traditional oat visit after party.. You always asking me to set you up :D :D ... these four years have been so wonderful with you being my friend. Needless to say this not the end and we'll be in touch. You are very talented person and wish you all the best for you future success.
