Hey Gangwar! Having you as part of my journey at IITK was really fun. Your interesting personality suits you quite well with your tech-enthusiastic nature. You dont stop at what is taught in the classroom, rather you go a step ahead to implement them in actual projects and thats something I admire you for. You are a wonderful friend and valuable companion to have. I believe that one day your zeal to learn stuffs will take you high up in the future. 

 Until next time, cheers! 

 P.S.- As smart as you are, I have always wondered why are you still single  :wink:
