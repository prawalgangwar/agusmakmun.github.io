Gangwar bro! Partayyy ! I don't remember the origins of our friendship. It's beautiful, it just happened. :) Bangalore brought us much closer when we'd have a fixed routine of McD dessert after lunch and evening snacks at the canteen and weekend parties every time. The bro wali story in Bangalore ... Haha :D . My go-to guy for fun times and the guy I'd find at all concerts on the campus. I'll never forget dancing like crazy with you at concerts and parties. You are a cool, fun-loving, outgoing and smart guy who is an amazing company. Cheers :D P.S. you never beat me at Age of Empires :P
