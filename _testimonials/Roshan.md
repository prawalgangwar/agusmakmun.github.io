Prawal has been my partner in crime in  a fair number
of intense albeit slightly "fraud" projects. It sure was fun to have those 
night-outs with you. Your constant ranting is what made us complete our work in time :stuck_out_tongue:.

He also sure can party hard! I found that out during our time in Bangalore. And Dude! you have a monstrous laughter. I hope you find what you missed out on in college after going to Bangalore :stuck_out_tongue:

Here's to all those good times and all the best for your upcoming endeavours. 
Stay in touch.
