Bhai, whatever time we have spent together in the past four years, has always been fun and joyous. Bohot kam instances honge jab maine tereko tensed dekha hoga, hamesa life me aise hi khus rehna. You have a heart of a child with being responsible and disciplined in the right proportion, which is very rare to find. I will never forget your fear of lizards :p and your spirit of trying and doing everything and anything. Apart from the first three years, the last year was the time when we had the most fun together. You were the partner in crime for everything in the last year. There are not many things that we did not do in the campus together. Our infinite trips to the canteen in the last year will always be the 'best bulla ever'.Milte to rahenge hi apan.. Aur aise hi khus rehna :) Hamesa!
