Yo roomie! Its quite difficult to sum of the 4 years with you because we have shared a lot. You became an indispensable part of my life, from sharing meals together, the large number of treats to the first 2 year in the same room.  I think we know every thing about each other, itna ki  kahi bhi kisi ki maar sakte h.  Hopefully the things remain same, and you consider me worthy enough to share your events when I am not around like you have always done. You are the most enthusiastic guy I have ever seen. Your way of seeing life is inspirational, taking things as they come and enjoy.  You have the ability of bringing life wherever you go, so don't let it vanish even if anyone complains. 
Umeed h jaldi hi aapki mulakaat hogi jinse aap chahte h.  Aise hi chaapte raho, and think about your plans to future. Don't let the surrounding people bring about a change in you.
Keep spreading the elixir of life, like you have been. I am lucky to have you. 
T o the endless number of Hindi songs, all three of us  have listened together.
Cheers!
