Although we became good friends only in the last semester, but I have shared so many moments with you - squash opponent, bitching partner, project mate, CBG group, farewell after-party planning and many more. I really like your frankness and honesty. 
Piece of advice - bhand mat hua kar jyada, you can't handle it very well.  :-P 
Looking forward to many more good times in Bangalore.  ;)
