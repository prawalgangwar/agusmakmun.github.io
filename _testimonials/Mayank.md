सुन्दर तो पीछे पड़ जाऊ, मैं जिद्दी होकर अड़ जाऊँ \|

आफ़त का हूँ मैं एटम बम, बात-बात पर लड़ जाऊँ \|

You are the person I have learnt the most from ( thats mostly how not to do stuff :stuck_out_tongue: ). The best thing about you is that you are completely aware of your self (Thanks for the tissues) . That puts you in a amazing position to capitalize on your strengths and work on your follies ( Way to go my friend :stuck_out_tongue:. You can laugh on embarrassing situations that would paint the likes of Mishra into the corner ( I know you are reading this :stuck_out_tongue:. Yes you judge people, but you judge them without any prejudices. To be dead honest, I have been disappointed and frustrated by you, at times even tried hating you for not caring enough but somehow eventually kept on loving the way you were :smile:.
