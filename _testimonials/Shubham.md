Hello Prawal, 
Words cannot define you. You really know how to enjoy things smallest of things. Bhai kiska hai! I am feeling like writing a rap (sadly I dont know how to) for you because of that nigga thing we did on insta. There will only be one Nigga and that is you, my brother. We had our fights & little arguments. But those were never more than that of siblings. 
You got a strong character, try to build on it. I really enjoyed having you as a brother. Dont worry, you will find a good girl. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: Be patient and a little bit more opportunistic. It was always fun to see you doing what you do best. Making people laugh with your laugh. Lets rock & roll because your music is just about to get noisy! Arigato and Sayonara.
