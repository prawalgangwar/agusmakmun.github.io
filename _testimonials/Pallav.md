You have been an indispensable part of my stay at IITK. Since the very first day on campus, you seemed to be the most interesting and quirky bhai that I had, although to be fair, you didn't really have much competition! As I've gotten to know you better over the years and have seen you through your ups and downs, the various layers of your personality and your diverse interests, I can't help being impressed by the multifaceted person that you are. I can say without any inhibitions that you were the most entertaining person of the wing and I had a really great time hanging with you! I have learnt a lot from your opinions, from your way of thinking and from your straightforward way of dealing with things. With the intellectual mind that you have, I'm sure that you're gonna excel in life and that one day, you'll definitely be able to find that true meaning of your life, something (or maybe even someone!) that motivates you to work hard and that makes it all worth it. Tab tak ke liye work hard, party a bit lesser, and to quote myself 'padh lo, bhala ho jayega!' I wish you enough.
