### My First blog post


Hi all this is my first blog post. This won't be long. I am currently interning at Indiana University in Bloomington in distributed Systems. The name of the blog quite evidently comes from two things: Techology and Tequilla, the two thigs that would keep me high in both spirit and joys of life. I believe my first blog will be about the intern and I would also be writing about the visit to Chicago. This blog would contain a lot of tech stuff and various things I like to do in my life. Hope to make it the good. :)
