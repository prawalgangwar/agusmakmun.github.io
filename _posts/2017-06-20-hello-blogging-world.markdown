### My First blog post


Hi all this is my first blog post. This won't be long. I am currently interning at Indiana University in Bloomington in distributed Systems. The name of the blog quite evidently comes from two things: Techology and Tequilla, the two thigs that would keep me high in both spirit and joys of life. I believe my first blog will be about the internship experience and I would also be writing about the various things I do and will be doing in my life. This blog would contain a lot of tech stuff and various things I like to do in my life. Hoping to make it the worthy of someone's time. :)
